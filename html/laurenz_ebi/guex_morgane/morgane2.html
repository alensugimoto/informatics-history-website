        In the early 1980s computers invaded British homes for the first time, a wave of cheap and futuristic devices that allowed millions of people to discover for themselves what a computer was. These fantastic machines, like the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron and Commodore 64, promised to make computing user-friendly for the first time. They were expected to reveal the wonders of information technology to the masses, and bring about a revolution in homes, schools, and workplaces. But to what extent did the electronic dreams these machines were sold on actually come true? What impact did home computers have on our lives in the 1980s?
        <br>
        <br>
        The biggest change that 1980s home computing brought about was probably in how people thought about computers. Historically, they were data processing machinery for scientists and big organisations; full of expensive electronics. They were rare – most people would never even have seen a computer in real life, and even a large organisation might only have a single computer. And they were gigantic because their circuitry was built of thousands of bulky electronic components like valves and transistors. The very notion of having one of these giant ‘electronic brains’ in your home was the stuff of science fiction – until, that is, developments in miniaturised microelectronics in the 1970s.
        <br>
        <br>
        By steadily improving technology, scientists squeezed ever more computer power onto ever smaller electronic components, reaching the point where all the circuitry needed to make a computer could be held on just a few tiny microchips.
        <br>
        <br>
        It all began to change in 1980: adverts began to appear for the Sinclair ZX80, the first computer available ready-made for under £100. The brainchild of the inventive Clive Sinclair, head of a small electronics company in Cambridge, the ZX80 looked a little like an overgrown calculator. It was a tiny machine, about 20cm square, with a miniature keyboard, and it simply plugged into a television. It offered modest computing power: no sound, a black-and-white display, and its one kilobyte of memory was just a millionth of that of a present day iPhone.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yet it was surprisingly versatile, affordable and easy for beginners to use. Advertised with the friendly slogan “inside a day you’ll be talking to it like an old friend,” the ZX80 proved to be a sensation and sold in huge numbers. It was the first of a series of home ‘microcomputers’ to offer user-friendly computing at a budget price, and a bewildering array of competing designs soon appeared on the market. Home computing boomed; by 1983 Britain boasted the highest level of computer ownership in the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        So why in the 1980s did so many people suddenly decide to buy a computer? The answer was initially educational: the spread of microchip-powered technologies in the 1970s brought prophecies of an information technology revolution that would overturn traditional life and work. Robots might replace industrial workers; word processors might take over from secretaries; even professional jobs in teaching or medicine might be replaced by expert computer software. There would be new opportunities in this ‘brave new world’, but those who did not learn about computers faced being left behind.
        <br>
        <br>
        Home computers were presented as a friendly introduction to a technology that was going to change the world. “We live in the age of computers,” cautioned a 1982 advert for the Commodore VIC-20 computer. “Coming to terms with them is part of coming to terms with the 20th century.” Parents were encouraged to buy computers for their children to help give them a good start in life. The BBC launched a huge computer literacy project to educate the nation, including television programmes, books, and even its own branded BBC Microcomputer, built by Acorn in Cambridge.

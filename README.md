# informatics-history-website

This reposity contains a website documenting the recent history in the field of informatics, going from 1968 to 2020.

This website was built through the collaboration of me and around 30 fellow undergraduate students and was completed as a part of a project assigned to us in the first semester of a three-year study programme.
